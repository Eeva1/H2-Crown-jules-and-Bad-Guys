## X) A summary of Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chain

- It was an eye opening reading the article and realize, that _Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense_ models & frameworks are coming from the U.S. military world, which clearly makes sence. I haven't ever taught that it is actually
  very logic to use the same models on  to try to defend organizations security.

- I understood how the intruders are working and behaving, how APT's are making the intrusions attacks constantly and continually. We also have a Defender in use so I can see all analytics in our environment.
- I learn constantly new when I'm in our environment and monitor the admin centers, for example Entra ID, Intunes and Defender.

- Indicators:
-   atomic = IP addresses
-   Computed = #-values and regular expressions
-   Behavioral = collections of atomic and computed indicators

-   Intrusion Kill Chain

## b) Threat Category: External Threats
Is it possible for a customer to pretend to be another customer?
Can your infrastructure be accessed by unauthorized external users?
Are end-user credentials being compromised?
Can users escalate their privileges?
In the event that a privileged user turns rogue, is there anything in place to discover and disarm them?


## Installing Debian on Virtual box

- I downloaded the latest version of Debian from the given site: live amd64 folder on cdimage.debian.org.

- My computer is Windows 10, so I had to download the VirtualBox Installer also and run it.

- Then I did all the steps adviced in Tero's installing manual to create the Linux virtual desktop inside to my Windows laptop.
- The latest updated OS version 12.2.0 was little bit different than 12.1.0 version in Teros installing manual, but all the same features could be found
- Name: DebianEevaNiemiCom
- Type: Linux
- Version: Debian (64bit)
- Memory Size: 4096 MB
- Create a virtual hard disk now: yes
- File size: little bit over 60 GB
- Then I went to settings and chose "Virtual Optical Disk File" and booted the computer.

- After booting I ran the installer and installed all settings as adviced: language, location, keyboard and partitions.
- Users: Eeva Niemi
- The name I want to use to login in: eeva
- The name of the computer: bobi
- I used a good pw and set "No" to "log in automatically without asking for the pw"
- And then I did couple of push-ups ;)
- After booting the computer gave me a black screen, but I am not sure what I did, because after couple of klicks it somehow started working and I could sign in.

After installing Debian I updatet everything as adviced
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
- sudo apt-get -y install ufw

- After updating firewalls etc. I tryed to install VirtualBox Guest Additions but my virtual computer doesn't have the "devices"
