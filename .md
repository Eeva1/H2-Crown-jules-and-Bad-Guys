## X) A summary of Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chain

- It was an eye opening reading the article and realize, that _Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense_ models & frameworks are coming from the U.S. military world, which clearly makes sence. I haven't taught that it is actually
  very logic to use the same models when defending organizations IT security.

- I understood from the article how the intruders are working and behaving and how APT's are making the intrusions attacks constantly and continually.
- With the help of machine learning algorythms and AI the intruding attemps have become more automated.
- It is important to analyze the behavior of intruders and how they operate and what is their intention.

- Indicators:
  - atomic = IP addresses
  - Computed = #-values and regular expressions
  - Behavioral = collections of atomic and computed indicators
  
- This subject is very topical in my work now, because we are changing our third party EPP & EDR security provider to Microsoft Defender in one month.
- Our licensing allows to set up all the integrations to the one environment/portal (Microsoft admin center). Defender also can measure the healthiness of the devices, so we do not need a third party vendor for that either anymore.
- Defender is based on different kinds of parameters, which are for example user & user rights and assuming the worst.
- For the past years Microsoft has invested and developed a modern Zero Trust framework, which uses machine learning algorythms and Artificial Intelligence to defend the hybrid work environment.
- It uses behavior modeling for threat analytics.
- It has automated investigation and response
- It can detect zero-day vulnerablities and is able to meet APT's.
- It uses the sandbox techniques for example to analyze files.
- Defender offers modern countermeasures like isolations & analysis, route cause analysis.
- The integrations can be made by using PowerShell, Intune and Entra ID for onboarding users/identities and devices to the MS Defender admin center.
- Defender supports all platforms (Windows, Android, iOS and MacOS).
- Defender admin center is a constant learning environment when monitoring the platform.
- Defender admin center is very interesting to monitor and you could easily spend hours in the day just for monitoring and learning new from the environment.
- The policies and rules in the environment are made based on every organizations best practices.
- Microsoft also gives Security Recommendations in the admin center.

 ## a) A treath model for my imaginary company named: Diamond tough defense

## b) Threat Category: External Threats

Reconnaisanse and Weaponization:
- A Russian criminal group CL0P attacked to the MOVEit data transfer software's vulnerability in different parts of the World as part of a broad campaign, and added Valmet technology company to their target.
  
Delivery & Exploitation:
- They added Valmet to the target list last July, and published the list in dark net where they claimed to have stolen the company information.
- That is how they pressed the company to pay the ransom. Normally there is a timer for the ransom payment, and if the payment is not made, the criminal group will publish the stolen information.

Installation
- Valmet confirms the information, but tells that only few old files and emails were stolen, and it doesn't have any effect to business. Valmet itself has not been subjected to any large-scale attack and they have informed the authorities when they found out the vulnerability. The attackers were not contacted Valmet either

Command and Control
- The same group is using the name TA505 also and typically it uses stolen information for blackmail by threatening to publish it.
- MOveit is not generally used in Finland.

## Installing Debian on Virtual box

- I downloaded the latest version of Debian from the given site: live amd64 folder on cdimage.debian.org.
- <img width="915" alt="debian2" src="https://github.com/Eeva1/H2-Crown-jules-and-Bad-Guys/assets/149093822/9bf391e0-bbff-438d-87cb-08a819d7fcdd">

- My computer is Windows 10, so I had to download the VirtualBox Installer also and run it.

- Then I did all the steps adviced in Tero's installing manual to create the Linux virtual desktop inside to my Windows laptop.
- The latest updated OS version 12.2.0 was little bit different than 12.1.0 version in Teros installing manual, but all the same features could be found
- Name: DebianEevaNiemiCom
- Type: Linux
- Version: Debian (64bit)
- Memory Size: 4096 MB
- Create a virtual hard disk now: yes
- File size: little bit over 60 GB
- Then I went to settings and chose "Virtual Optical Disk File" and booted the computer.

- After booting I ran the installer and installed all settings as adviced: language, location, keyboard and partitions.
- Users: Eeva Niemi
- The name I want to use to login in: eeva
- The name of the computer: bobi
- I used a good pw and set "No" to "log in automatically without asking for the pw"
- And then I did couple of push-ups ;)
- After booting the computer gave me a black screen, but I am not sure what I did, because after couple of klicks it somehow started working and I could sign in.

After installing Debian I updatet everything as adviced
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
- sudo apt-get -y install ufw
- sudo ufw enable

- After updating firewalls etc. I tryed to install VirtualBox Guest Additions but my virtual computer doesn't have the "devices"

- This is as far as I got...
